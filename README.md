# üí∞ Ethereum-Tax-Stack

**Ethereum-Tax-Stack** is a full-stack **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** application designed to **analyze Ethereum transactions** and extract **monetary and tax-related insights**.

Developed by [@devnova](https://github.com/devnova777) this project automates the process of fetching Ethereum wallet data, storing it in a database, and visualizing financial statistics relevant to crypto taxation.

## üß† Project Overview

The goal of **Ethereum-Tax-Stack** is to provide a simple yet powerful tool for users to:

* Fetch Ethereum transaction history via the **Etherscan API**.
* Store and manage transaction data in a **MongoDB** database.
* Compute essential tax-related figures such as total gains/losses, transaction costs, and portfolio performance.
* Visualize financial data using an interactive **React** dashboard.

## ‚úÖ Development Progress

### **1. Environment Setup** ‚úÖ

* Initialized full MERN stack locally.
* Established communication between **MongoDB**, **Express**, and **Node.js** servers.

### **2. API Integration** ‚úÖ

* Connected to **Etherscan API** and successfully retrieved transaction data.
* Implemented a method to parse and store Etherscan data into **MongoDB** for persistence.

### **3. Frontend Functionality** üèóÔ∏è *In Progress*

* Building functions to fetch backend data and render transaction analytics.
* Developing mathematical models to compute monetary metrics (e.g., realized/unrealized gains, transaction totals).

### **4. Frontend Design & Visualization** üé® *Planned*

* Design high-fidelity UI/UX mockups using **Figma** or similar tools.
* Integrate **Recharts** for graphical representation of user data.
* Develop a responsive dashboard interface for intuitive visualization and analysis.

## üìä Planned Features

* Wallet address lookup for on-chain tax summaries.
* Time-based transaction breakdown (daily, monthly, annual).
* Capital gains and loss computation for different tokens.
* Exportable tax reports (PDF/CSV).
* Secure user authentication and data encryption.

## üöÄ Summary

**Ethereum-Tax-Stack** aims to bridge the gap between blockchain data and real-world tax reporting.
By combining on-chain analytics, data visualization, and a clean user interface, it empowers crypto users to track and understand their taxable activities with ease.
